# Horse Racing - This is test only application, just to test the Apis built at https://github.com/harshane/techchallenge_api

## To Run this Application locally Simple Hit F5, CustomerBet API need to be running for this App to work

## Dependecies
	Keep the CustomerBet Api running as this application uses Api from CustomerBetApi

## How much money we need to pay out if this horse wins (Races are tote races so calculate using the odds from the horse)
	# This part is not taken care in the implementation as did not build customer centric Race page, and the Calculation required customer bet amount.
